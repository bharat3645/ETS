## Lessons Learned

Our goal was to create a dynamic, authenticated website tailored for young audiences, requiring extensive use of various technologies. One of the biggest challenges we faced was ensuring that all the technical components worked seamlessly together without compromising the websiteâ€™s performance. Despite these challenges, we remained committed to our vision and successfully built everything from scratch.

However, due to financial constraints, we were unable to integrate a traditional database system. To overcome this limitation, we opted to use JSON files as an alternative storage solution. By structuring and managing data efficiently within JSON, we were able to mimic database-like functionality, ensuring smooth data handling and retrieval. This approach allowed us to maintain the websiteâ€™s core functionalities while staying within our budget.
